# Fiix Angular Interview Exercise

## Instructions

- Fork this repo and make commits against your forked version
- Set a timer for 2 hours and complete as many of the following tasks as you can
  - You will not be assessed on the amount completed - there is more than you are expected to complete in this time
  - Try to complete a range of different kinds of tasks (style, tests, components, etc.)
- Use the git CLI (not a GUI like sourcetree) to make commits, as this will trigger a pre-commit hook to auto-format the code
  - So, no need to worry about code formatting (spacing, new lines, etc.) while writing code as this will be done automatically
- `BlogService` class provides a mock API to use
  - No changes are required in this file, you can treat it as a generated file
  - If you find you need to change this file you may - please add comments explaining reasoning if so
- Make use of Angular Material components where possible / where it will save time: https://material.angular.io/components/categories
- Feel free to use any resources at your disposal (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.)
